  "explanation.dnsExplanation": "Nearly everything on the Internet starts with a DNS request. DNS is the Internet’s directory. Click on a link, open an app, send an email and the first thing your device does is ask the directory: <strong class=\"subtle\">Where can I find this?</strong>",
  "explanation.dnsSlowInsecure": "Unfortunately, by default, DNS is usually slow and insecure. Your ISP, and anyone else listening in on the Internet, can see every site you visit and every app you use — even if their content is encrypted. Creepily, some DNS providers sell data about your Internet activity or use it to target you with ads.",
  "explanation.dnsAlternative": "We think that’s gross. If you do too, now there’s an alternative: <strong class=\"code\">1.1.1.1</strong>",

  "explanation.privacyHeader": "Privacy First: Guaranteed.",
  "explanation.privacyExplanation": "We’re rethinking the 1983-era DNS protocol. <strong class=\"code\">1.1.1.1</strong> supports encrypted DNS as well as DNS over HTTPS.",
  "explanation.privacyGuaranteeData": "<span class=\"mobile-emphasis\">We will never sell your data or use it to target ads.</span> Period.",
  "explanation.privacyGuaranteeLogs": "<span class=\"mobile-emphasis\">We will never log your IP address</span> (the way other companies identify you). And we’re not just saying that. We’ve retained a big 4 accounting firm to audit our assertions about our systems annually to ensure that we're doing what we say.",
  "explanation.privacyConclusion": "Frankly, we don’t want to know what you do on the Internet—it’s none of our business—and we’ve taken the technical steps to ensure we can’t.",

  "explanation.performanceHeader": "Faster than anything else.",
  "explanation.fastestDNS": "We’ve built 1.1.1.1 to be the Internet’s fastest DNS directory. Don’t take our word for it. The independent DNS monitor <a href='https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers' target='_blank'>DNSPerf</a> ranks 1.1.1.1 the fastest DNS service in the world.",

  "faqpage.header": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faqpage.general": "General",
  "faqpage.whatIsQ": "What is 1.1.1.1?",
  "faqpage.whatIsA1": "When you request to visit an application like cloudflare.com, your computer needs to know which server to connect you to so that it can load the application. Computers don’t know how to do this name to address translation, so they ask a specialized server to do it for them.",
  "faqpage.whatIsA2": "This specialized server is called a DNS recursive resolver. The resolver’s job is to find the address for a given name, like 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 for cloudflare.com, and return it to the computer that asked for it.",
  "faqpage.whatIsA3": "Computers are configured to talk to specific DNS resolvers, identified by IP address. Usually, the configuration is managed by your ISP (like Comcast or AT&T) if you’re on your home or wireless internet, and by your network administrator if you’re connected to the office internet. You can also change the configured DNS resolver your computer talks to yourself.",
  "faqpage.whatDoDNSQ": "What do DNS resolvers do?",
  "faqpage.whatDoDNSA1": "How do resolvers know how to find the address of a domain name? They work backwards from the top.",
  "faqpage.whatDoDNSA2": "Every resolver knows how to find the invisible ‘.’ at the end of domain names (e.g. cloudflare.com.). There are <a href='http://www.root-servers.org/' target='_blank'>hundreds of servers</a> all over the world that host the ‘.’ file. Cloudflare itself hosts <a href='https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone' target='_blank'>that file</a> on all of its servers around the world through a <a href='https://blog.cloudflare.com/f-root/' target='_blank'>partnership with ISC</a>. Resolvers are <a href='https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root' target='_blank'>hard coded to know the IP addresses of those servers</a>.",
  "faqpage.whatDoDNSA3": "The resolver asks one of the root servers where to find the next link in the chain, the TLD or domain ending. An example of a TLD is .com or .org. Luckily the root servers store the locations of all the TLD servers, so they can return which IP address the DNS resolver should go ask next.",
  "faqpage.whatDoDNSA4": "The resolver then asks the TLD’s servers where it can find the domain it is looking for, for example, a resolver might ask .com where to find cloudflare.com. TLD’s host a file containing the location of every domain using the TLD. Once the resolver has the final IP address, it returns the answer to the computer that asked.",
  "faqpage.whatDoDNSA5": "This whole system - with the servers that host the information (they are called authoritative DNS) and the servers that seek the information (the DNS resolvers) is called the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is like Google Maps for the internet. It translates the name of places to addresses so that you can figure out how to get there.",

  "faqpage.clearCacheA": "You can refresh 1.1.1.1’s DNS cache for domain names by using the <a href='https://cloudflare-dns.com/purge-cache/' target='_blank'>purge cache tool</a>. You have to enter the domain name, pick the DNS record type (or types) and hit the ‘Purge Cache’ button.",
  "faqpage.insideChinaQ": "Does 1.1.1.1 work inside China?",
  "faqpage.insideChinaA": "Not really. You can configure your DNS to point towards 1.1.1.1 but it will not reach one of our data centers inside China. Instead, the request will route to one of our data centers outside of Mainland China.",
  "faqpage.devDocsQ": "Where can I find 1.1.1.1’s developer docs?",
  "faqpage.devDocsA": "Here",
  "faqpage.mobileApp": "Mobile App",
  "faqpage.mobileAppWorkQ": "How does the mobile app work?",
  "faqpage.mobileAppWorkA": "The app runs a local resolver inside your mobile phone that asks all the other apps to send their DNS requests to the address of this resolver. Once these DNS requests reach the local resolver, it encrypts them and sends them to 1.1.1.1.",
  "faqpage.vpnQ": "Is the 1.1.1.1 app a VPN?",
  "faqpage.vpnA": "No. A VPN app typically proxies all of your network traffic. The 1.1.1.1 app only overrides and secures your mobile phone’s DNS traffic.",
  "faqpage.dnsLogsQ": "What are DNS logs?",
  "faqpage.dnsLogsA": "The DNS logs on iOS contain all the DNS queries that your phone makes. Your apps and mobile browser usually generate these DNS queries.",
  "faqpage.logsForQ": "What are the console logs for?",
  "faqpage.logsForA": "The console logs are there to help Cloudflare debug your connection.",
  "faqpage.suggestQ": "How can I suggest an improvement?",
  "faqpage.suggestA": "We read all of your suggestions. You can shake the phone while in the app and send your suggestions for improvements. Alternatively, you can go to the app menu and tap on ‘Help’ to send your feedback.",
  "faqpage.diffDnsTlsQ": "What is the difference between using DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS?",
  "faqpage.diffDnsTlsA1": "Both DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS encrypt plain DNS queries from the phone.",
  "faqpage.diffDnsTlsA2": "DNS over HTTPS uses port 443 and DNS over TLS uses port 853. In some networks, one of these ports might be blocked. If port 443 is blocked you should use DNS over TLS. If port 853 is blocked, you should use DNS over HTTPS. In some cases, DNS over TLS may be faster than DNS over HTTPS or the other way around.",
  "faqpage.bugQ": "How can I send a bug report?",
  "faqpage.bugA": "You can shake the app and send a bug report. When you do that, the app attaches a screenshot and the console logs along with the bug report. The console log helps us debug your connection and improve your overall app experience.",
  "faqpage.internetStoppedQ": "My internet stopped working when I was using the 1.1.1.1 app. What should I do?",
  "faqpage.internetStoppedA": "If this happens, try turning the app off and on again by using the toggle from the app home page. If the issue persists, please disable the app and send us a bug report.",
  "faqpage.appStuckQ": "The 1.1.1.1 app is stuck in ‘CONNECTING’ or ‘REASSERTING’. What should I do?",

  "faqpage.cannotClickQ": "I cannot click OK on the VPN installation dialog. What should I do?",
  "faqpage.cannotClickA": "If you cannot click on the OK button, there might be another application on top of the dialog. Some known apps that can cause this problem are Lux Brightness, Night Mode, Twilight, FileManager etc. To avoid this problem, close or uninstall all apps that might cause this problem.",
  "faqpage.appenabledQ": "I kept the app enabled but I noticed it turned off after a while. What happened?",
  "faqpage.appenabledA1": "Your phone is trying to manage the battery by disabling the app. For example, most Huawei devices are known for their aggressive memory and power management.",

  "faqpage.persistentnotificationA2": "This is required by the Android OS (8.0+) for all apps with background activity.",

  "faqpage.disablednotificationA1": "You should not be worried. Because you disabled notification for the app the Android OS now sends another notification warning you about battery usage not because it is consuming a lot of battery but because it is running in the background (in this case, securing all of your DNS queries!).",
