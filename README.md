# 1.1.1.1 Site

### _Cloudflare DNS Resolver and Warp Website_

## Contributing

The 1.1.1.1 documentation site is built using TypeScript, Pug templates, and Stylus stylesheets. Webpack is used to compile these assets into a build hosted on Cloudflare. A local copy can be run by first installing the project dependencies with Yarn (or NPM).

### Requirements

- *nix or MacOS operating system
- Node 9.x or higher

```bash
yarn install
```

Once that command completes, start the development server.

```bash
yarn start
```

Your console will display an IP address that serves the project.
